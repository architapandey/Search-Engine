# Search Engine with Backend Web Crawler

## Overview

This project is a search engine that utilizes a backend web crawler [Link](https://github.com/architapandey/crawler) to index and retrieve information from websites. The backend crawler, based on a DFS algorithm and a ranking system, fetches data and stores it in a MySQL database. The front end is designed to query this database and display search results.

## Features

- **Web Crawler:** The backend crawler navigates websites using Depth-First Search (DFS) and applies a ranking algorithm to fetch and store data in a MySQL database.
- **Search Engine UI:** The front end provides a user interface for searching indexed data stored in the MySQL database.
- **Indexing and Ranking:** The search results are based on the indexing and ranking performed by the web crawler.
